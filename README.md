The project is a task manager that allows users to create, view, and filter tasks based on categories and deadlines, using OOP, C#, and SQL. It enables users to add tasks and view them by priority order or due date. 

On the OOP side, techniques like inheritance and polymorphism were applied to organize and structure the system in a modular and reusable way. A base Task class was created to encapsulate common properties such as title, category, and priority, from which the DeadlineTask class was derived to add due date functionality.

Interaction with the database was done using SQL to store and retrieve tasks.

The project also includes an interactive menu for users, allowing task creation, querying by deadline or priority, and generating quick reports, all organized in a practical way to facilitate task management.
